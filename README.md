# README

This project works like this:
You enter repetitive problems, repetitive things you encounter in life.
Enter the connections between them.
And the website recursively analyzes the connections between records to tell you what to solve first.

Success Stories:
First version some parts of code, which made me able to submit jobs 10 times faster than regular programmers; I didn't value the resource but there was another project in the world that did the same thing - Rubocop - and that project became the modern standard of website development on Ruby - every website in the world now must have Rubocop to be completed this algorythm I did on paper (was recording repetitive things I encountered in life, in programming etc). So after marking every record wether it depends on something or not I created Caperoma - a project of programming automation (that saved 30% of budget through metaprogramming microoptimizations - in other words automation of writing some parts of code, which made me able to submit jobs 10 times faster than regular programmers; I didn't value the resource but there was another project in the world that did the same thing - Rubocop - and that project became the modern standard of website development on Ruby - every website in the world now must have Rubocop to be completed).
Second version of this algorythm was digital. I created thousands of records and made connections between them. At the time the algorythm marked records as "irrelevant" if they depended on anything. Thus one day the list of records simplified. The program told me that none of it really matters. The only thing that matters is Learning Math. Once I do it, my thousands of records become not a problem. So I did. I spent a year learning Math from ground up. From most basic levels up to deepest layers of Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations etc. I didn't have the resources back then to keep studying (Analysis etc.). I wanted to. But online resources for those fields are not present in the web for now. So I just moved on with other things. And this is true, all thousands of records became irrelevant.
Occasionally I tried to keep track of records in my head. Which is much more difficult and inaccurate but it still gives results. For example:
- I noticed that I have a repetitive event of bank loans. So I made a map of every possible source of money in my life down to the most absurd ones, and after seeing the entire picture I decided that I need to have projects be separate from one another and contribute 14% of their income to a common fund that supports all the projects I have. Thus, I made Vinogradoff Group.
- I saw a community of R&D specialists in a field of Lucid Dreams. They had a repetitive problem of "trying everything that works" without assuming what can work and what can't based on previous experience. So I made a mathematical research and made them a breakthrough that will probably help future generations of Brain & Sleep Researches (tl; dr: Panaramic Detalization. The wider is your view in a dream, and the more detailed are parts across the entire field of view of the dream, the more realistic and long the dream is, and the more control you have over your actions in it).
- Actually I do a lot of it in my head automatically at this point. Sometimes I do it using maps (make a mind map of repetitive processes of a project).
- Lately I seem to work a lot as a business analyst (optimizing businesses to become efficient, reliable, scalable etc.). As those people understand the value, and for me informational architecture it's not that difficult.

So yeah.
I made this website available for the public mostly so that my clients can use my approach when I'm not around to help them.
If you want you can use it too. I'm sure it will help you. Or you can contact me and we will arrange a meeting or something.
