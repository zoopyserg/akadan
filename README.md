# README

This project works like this:
You enter repetitive problems, repetitive things you encounter in life.
Enter the connections between them.
And the website recursively analyzes the connections between records to tell you what to solve first.

Success Stories:
First version some parts of code, which made me able to submit jobs 10 times faster than regular programmers; I didn't value the resource but there was another project in the world that did the same thing - Rubocop - and that project became the modern standard of website development on Ruby - every website in the world now must have Rubocop to be completed this algorythm I did on paper (was recording repetitive things I encountered in life, in programming etc). So after marking every record wether it depends on something or not I created Caperoma - a project of programming automation (that saved 30% of budget through metaprogramming microoptimizations - in other words automation of writing some parts of code, which made me able to submit jobs 10 times faster than regular programmers; I didn't value the resource but there was another project in the world that did the same thing - Rubocop - and that project became the modern standard of website development on Ruby - every website in the world now must have Rubocop to be completed).
Second version of this algorythm was digital. I created thousands of records and made connections between them. At the time the algorythm marked records as "irrelevant" if they depended on anything. Thus one day the list of records simplified. The program told me that none of it really matters. The only thing that matters is Learning Math. Once I do it, my thousands of records become not a problem. So I did. I spent a year learning Math from ground up. From most basic levels up to deepest layers of Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations etc. I didn't have the resources back then to keep studying (Analysis etc.). I wanted to. But online resources for those fields are not present in the web for now. So I just moved on with other things. And this is true, all thousands of records became irrelevant.
Occasionally I tried to keep track of records in my head. Which is much more difficult and inaccurate but it still gives results. For example:
- I noticed that I have a repetitive event of bank loans. So I made a map of every possible source of money in my life down to the most absurd ones, and after seeing the entire picture I decided that I need to have projects be separate from one another and contribute 14% of their income to a common fund that supports all the projects I have. Thus, I made Vinogradoff Group.
- I saw a community of R&D specialists in a field of Lucid Dreams. They had a repetitive problem of "trying everything that works" without assuming what can work and what can't based on previous experience. So I made a mathematical research and made them a breakthrough that will probably help future generations of Brain & Sleep Researches (tl; dr: Panaramic Detalization. The wider is your view in a dream, and the more detailed are parts across the entire field of view of the dream, the more realistic and long the dream is, and the more control you have over your actions in it).
- Actually I do a lot of it in my head automatically at this point. Sometimes I do it using maps (make a mind map of repetitive processes of a project).
- Lately I seem to work a lot as a business analyst (optimizing businesses to become efficient, reliable, scalable etc.). As those people understand the value, and for me informational architecture it's not that difficult.

So yeah.
I made this website available for the public mostly so that my clients can use my approach when I'm not around to help them.
If you want you can use it too. I'm sure it will help you. Or you can contact me and we will arrange a meeting or something.


PENDING:
OAuth (registration etc)
To see in header if I'm logged in or not (my name vs login button etc).
And I wanna be able to see "only my" records etc. I not always want to see public ones.
And staging db is not populated.
Change Admin password to a long ENV variable
"Repetitive Task" item is not present at all. and is not default.
can't edit "is_public" parameter (in permissions, didn't make them at all)
languages (I want to read/type in russian, thus I want to select russian record names etc, I wanted to make columns for every translation, didn't do it yet)
В форме редактирования записи есть пункт "таймер точки" (да и в точках тоже). и он в формате часы минуты секунды. а в базе я сохраняю интеджер. в итоге я не могу даже это поле отредактировать потому что там маска.
Да и дни в длительность тоже есть смысл добавить. потому что есть вещи которые повторяются которые длятся годами. "президент Путин снова президент. повторение длится 25 лет."
Загрузка картинок, рисование дудлов и загрузка файлов в пункте не работают.
Чекбоксы (булк экшены над записями), сенсоры, аттачменты в шоу пейдже - всё это не функционирует. Как и кнопки "построить завод", "сделано отдельное помещение" и т.п.
Хочу иметь возможность закопипестить много пунктов сразу. Не каждый в отдельной строчке а одно поле чтоб скопировать 500 штук.
И проблемно выбирать "дефолтный коннекшн тайп" каждый раз когда создаю подпункты.
10 подпунктов мало. надо возможность добавлять сколько мне надо. или же делать таки одно поле на все.
поиск по пунктам не работает.
проблемно искать нужную страницу (где там "все мои пункты" и т.д.)
all user input is error. а здесь даже я почти ошибся когда кликнуть криейт хотел но не выбрал что это подзадача.
create/connect subrecords переименуй в create subrecords (потому что коннекшены к существующим я не создаю)
20 пунктов сабмитует секунд 3-5. даже на локалхосте. это долго.
комментарии к пунктам не работают
